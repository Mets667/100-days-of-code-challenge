# 100-days-of-code-challenge

Right now I'm trying to get back into the coding game so I can get the job of my dreams! It's been a long, winding, difficult road, but I have to have faith in what I'm doing, the courage to fail and get back up stronger than before. Thank you for reading this and I hope my work is okay (if not you can help me out...It would be much appreciated!)
